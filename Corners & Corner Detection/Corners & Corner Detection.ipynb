    "# Corner Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, you'd be tempted to match small \"patches\" between the two images. However, if there are no unique \"features\" to identify an object, you'll have problem in finding corresponding points. So, the patch matching approach alone isn't that great.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corners:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These points are uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "- They are also stable. In other words, these points usually don't keep moving around in the image. This helps tracking. And any motion of this point, even a little one, produces a large variation. You can clearly see the point moving around.\n",
    "- There should be a variation around a corner. Mathematically, this is implied by the derivative change in all directions. **Around the corners, the second derivative also changes in all directions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect the same point **independently** in different images. In other words, the detector must be **repeatable** even under different conditions. Particularly, it must be **invariant to geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, scale, affine transformations** as well as **photometric transformations such as lighting variations, noise, blur, quantization errors**. \n",
    "- Given a keypoint in an image, the detector must **correctly** find the corresponding keypoint in the other image. In other words, the descriptor that detector generates must be **reliable** and **distinctive**.\n",
    "- **Locality** is needed to achieve robustness to occlusion and clutter.\n",
    "- **Quantity**, i.e. sufficent number of regions to cover the object, is important.\n",
    "- **Efficiency** is expected to provide real-time performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Harris Corner Detector:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harris Corner Detector is a **rotation** and **illumination invariant**, and efficient mathematical operator to determine which windows produce large variations when moved in any direction. With each window, a score R is associated. Based on this score, you can figure out which ones are corners and which ones are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, in 1994, Shi and Tomasi came up with a better corner detection scheme. Their work involved only minor changes in the Harris Corner Detector, but were able to produce better results in corner detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the gradient at each point in the image.\n",
    "- Create the H matrix (autocorrelation matrix) from the entries in the gradient at each point.\n",
    "- Compute eigenvalues & find points with large response (Cornerness check: $\\lambda_{-}>threshold$).\n",
    "- Choose the points where $\\lambda_{-}$ is a local maximum as features. (non-maximum suppression)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](window-move.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our aim is to find little patches of image (or \"windows\") that generate a large variation when moved around. Have a look at this image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-low-variation.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The red square is the window we've chosen. Moving it around doesn't show much of variation. That is, the difference between the window, and the original image below it is very low.\n",
    "- Of course, if you move the window too much, like onto the reddish region, you're bound to see a big difference. But we've moved the window too much. Not good.\n",
    "- In the picture below, even the little movement of the window produces a noticeable difference. This is the kind of window we're looking for:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-high-variation.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here's how it translates mathematically (autocorrelation function):\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation1.jpg)\n",
    "- where:\n",
    "  - E is the difference between the original and the moved window.\n",
    "  - u is the window's displacement in the x direction\n",
    "  - v is the window's displacement in the y direction\n",
    "  - w(x, y) is the window at position (x, y). This acts like a mask. Ensuring that only the desired window is used.\n",
    "  - I is the intensity of the image at a position (x, y)\n",
    "  - I(x+u, y+v) is the intensity of the moved window\n",
    "  - I(x, y) is the intensity of the original\n",
    "\n",
    "- We've looking for windows (w) that produce **a large E value for small shifts (by (u,v)) in all directions**. To do that, we need to high values of the terms inside the square brackets.\n",
    "- So, we maximize this term:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- To simplify the process, we expand this term **by using the Taylor series**. In other words, rewrite the term by using its derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-taylor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- See how the I(x+u, y+v) changed into a totally different form: I(x,y) + uIx + vIy. Because the Taylor series is infinite, we've ignored all terms after the first three. It gives a pretty good approximation. But it isn't the actual value.\n",
    "- Next, we expand the square. The I(x,y) cancels out, so its just two terms we need to square. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation4.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now this equation can be turned into a matrix form like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation5.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, we rename the summed-matrix, and put it to be M:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation6.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- So, the equation now becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation7.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suitability of a Window:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was figured out that **eigenvalues** of the matrix can help determine the suitability of a window:\n",
    "  - Eigenvector corresponding to the larger eigenvalue of H (or M) **maximizes** E(u,v).\n",
    "  - Eigenvector corresponding to the smaller eigenvalue of H (or M) **minimizes** E(u,v).\n",
    "  - Idea is, even **the minimum of E(u,v)** should be **large** over all unit vectors (u,v).\n",
    "  - Therefore, the **smaller eigenvalue $\\lambda_{-}$** of H is used.\n",
    "- Alternatively, due to the performance issues, the score R can be calculated for each window:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](harris-equation8.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- All windows that have a score R **greater than a certain threshold are corners**. They are good tracking points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](ellipse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"dist.png\" style=\"width:500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](geometric-interpret.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](score-isoresponse-contours.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the two eigenvalues:\n",
    "  - **Both** eigenvalues are **small**, then the pixel is **flat** (the white region)\n",
    "  - **One** eigenvalue is **large**, and the other is small, then the pixel is an **edge** (the gray region)\n",
    "  - **Both** eigenvalues are **large**, then the pixel is a **corner** (the crossed region)\n",
    "- The figure also show contours for the score function. On selecting a proper value, you get positive values in the corner region, and negative values everywhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two possible choices of window function:\n",
    "  - Uniform window: Sum of all entries within the window with equal weight. **Rotation variant**.\n",
    "  - Window smoothed with Gaussian: Weighted sum of all entries within the window. **Rotation invariant**.\n",
