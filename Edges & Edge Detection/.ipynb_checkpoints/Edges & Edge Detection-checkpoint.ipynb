    "\n",
    "## Edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edges are points where there is a boundary (or an edge) between two image regions. In general, an edge can be of almost arbitrary shape, and may include junctions. In practice, edges are usually defined as sets of points in the image which **have a strong gradient magnitude**. Furthermore, some common algorithms will then chain high gradient points together to form a more complete description of an edge.\n",
    "- Formally, edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying points in a digital image at which the **image brightness changes sharply or suddenly**; in other words, the image has **discontinuities** in order to capture important events and changes in properties of the world. The points at which image brightness changes sharply are typically organized into a set of one-dimensional curved line segments termed edges.\n",
    "- Under general assumptions for an image formation model, discontinuities in image brightness are likely to correspond to:\n",
    "  - Discontinuities in **depth**\n",
    "  - Discontinuities in **surface orientation** (or, surface normal)\n",
    "  - Changes in **material properties** (or, surface color)\n",
    "  - Variations in **scene illumination**\n",
    " \n",
    "![image](discontinuities.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edges are important because:\n",
    "  - Most semantic and shape information from the image can be encoded in the edges.\n",
    "  - Edges allow extracting information, recognizing objects.\n",
    "  - Edges also enable us to recover geometry and viewpoint. (with the help of perspective theory)\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Gradient-based Approach to Detect Edges:\n",
    "\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The curve representing intensity </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The lower part is the 1-D image (i.e. image of size 1 row (1xN matrix)). \n",
    "- The upper part is **the intensity of each pixel** of the 1-D image plotted (i.e. intensity vs position) as a graph. \n",
    "- Black has a **low intensity**, so the graph curve is low. \n",
    "- It reaches full height at the right end of the image since white has **high intensity**.\n",
    "- Note that the center of the curve has a steep slope - meaning you've got an edge!\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](sample-edge-first-derivative.jpg)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The first derivative of the curve above</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking for these peaks is exactly what gradient based edge detection methods do. \n",
    "- You're not interested in what the actual colors are. If the change is steep enough, you mark it as an edge pixel. \n",
    "- Though these methods work well, there's one drawback: how do you decide what is a peak and what isn't? \n",
    "- There has to be a certain threshold above which an edge is classified as a peak, else it must be considered part of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](sample-edge-second-derivative.jpg)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The second order derivative</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the left (where the curve is rising), the slope is positive. \n",
    "- On the right, the slope is negative. \n",
    "- So, there must exist a point where there is a zero crossing. That point is the edge's location. \n",
    "- Edge detectors that are based on this idea are called Laplacian edge detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "This approach is actually based on continuous images. For us, that is **never** the case. So we'll have to **approximate these derivatives** based on the pixelated/quantized data that we do have. This is done with the help of **convolutions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria for Optimal Edge Detector:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Detection: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimize** the probability of **false positives** (detecting spurious edges caused by noise), as well as that of **false negatives** (missing real edges)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Localization: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The edges detected must be **as close as possible to the true edges**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single response: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Return **one point only for each true edge point**. That is, minimize the number of local maxima around the true edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smoothing:\n",

    "## The Canny Edge Detector:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The canny edge detector is a multistage edge detection algorithm. The steps are:\n",
    "  1. Preprocessing\n",
    "  2. Calculating gradients\n",
    "  3. Non-maximum suppression\n",
    "  4. Thresholding with hysterysis\n",
    "- The two key parameters of the algorithm are: \n",
    "  - Upper threshold which is used to mark edges that are definitely edges\n",
    "  - Lower threshold which is used to find faint pixels that are actually a part of an edge. \n",
    "- Effect of $\\sigma$ (Gaussian kernel spread/size):\n",
    "  - large $\\sigma$ detects large scale edges\n",
    "  - small $\\sigma$ detects fine features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Edge detectors are prone to noise. A bit of smoothing with a Gaussian blur helps. \n",
    "- Generally, software packages don't do this step automatically, you need to do this yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Calculating Gradients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradients are obtained with the standard **Sobel edge detector**.\n",
    "- Next, gradient magnitudes and directions are calculated at every single point in the image. \n",
    "- The magnitude of the gradient at a point determines if it possibly lies on an edge or not: \n",
    "  - A high gradient magnitude means the colors are changing rapidly, implying the existence of an edge. \n",
    "  - A low gradient implies no substantial changes, implying it's not an edge.\n",
    "- The gradient vector points in the direction of most rapid increase in intensity. (which is perpendicular to edge direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Non-maximum Suppression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a pixel is not a maximum, it is suppressed. \n",
    "- To do this, you iterate over all pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](possible-neighbors.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The orientation of each pixel is put into one of the four bins.\n",
    "- There are four bins because there are **only four edges possible**. Let's say you're at the grey pixel, an edge could go:\n",
    "  - from north to south (the green neighbors)\n",
    "  - from east to west (the blue ones)\n",
    "  - from one of the diagonals (the yellow or red neighbors)\n",
    "- So using the current pixel's gradient direction, you try and estimate where the edge is going. \n",
    "- The four possibilities need to be treated separately to check for nonmaximum suppression. I'll explain one possibility in detail. The others are the same, with minor differences.\n",
    "- After non-maximum suppression, you'll get something called 'thin edges'. This might be broken at various points. We'll fix this by filling in gaps with another threshold (with hysteresis).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Gradient Orientation from 22.5° to 67.5°:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](edge-direction-451.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the gradient orientation is in this range, this means intensity change occurs in this direction, i.e. **from the top left corner to the bottom right corner**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This means the edge lies **from the top right corner to bottom left (the red line)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To check if the central red pixel belongs to an edge, you need to check if the gradient is maximum at this point. You do this by comparing its magnitude **with the top left pixel and the bottom right pixel**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If it is maximum and its magnitude is greater than the upper threshold, you mark this pixel as an \"edge pixel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: \n",
    "\n",
    "**An edge is always perpendicular to the gradient direction.** Intensities do not change along an edge. They change across the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Other Gradient Orientations:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](edge-direction-all.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other gradient directions are handled similarly:\n",
    "  - 67.5 to 112.5 degrees: The gradient is from top to bottom. This means the edge is from left to right. So you check gradient magnitudes against the pixels right above and below.\n",
    "  - 112.5 to 157.5 degrees: The gradient is the other diagonal.\n",
    "  - 0-22.5 or 157.5-180 degrees: The gradient is horizontal. So the edge is vertical. So you check the pixels to the left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thresholding with Hysterysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the previous step, we marked pixels that had a gradient magnitude greater than the upper threshold. Now using the direction information and the lower threshold, we'll \"grow\" these edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current pixel is not an edge, check the next one.\n",
    "- If it is an edge, check the two pixels **in the direction of the edge** (i.e., **perpendicular to the gradient direction**). You can mark each of these pixels as an edge pixel if, for each pixel, if the pixel:\n",
    "  - has **the direction in the same bin (range of angles) as the central pixel**\n",
    "  - has Gradient magnitude which is **greater than the lower threshold**\n",
    "  - is **the maximum compared to their neighbors** (non-maximum suppression for these pixels),\n",
    "- Loop until there are no changes in the image. \n",
    "- Once the image stops changing, you've got your canny edges!"
